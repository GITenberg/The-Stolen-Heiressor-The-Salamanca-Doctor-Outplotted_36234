<i>Enter Count</i> Gravello <i>and</i> Rosco.
</p></div>

<blockquote><p><i>Gravello. ROSCO!</i></p>

<p><i>Rosco.</i> My Lord.</p>

<p><i>Grav.</i> Hast thou divulg'd the News that my
Son died at <i>Rome</i>?</p>

<p><i>Rosco.</i> Yes, my Lord, with every Circumstance, the
Time, the Place, and Manner of his Death; that 'tis
believed, and told for Truth with as much Confidence, as
if they had been Spectators of his End.</p>

<p><i>Grav.</i> That's well, that's very well, now <i>Rosco</i> follows
my Part, I must express a most unusual Grief, not like a
well-left Heir for his dead Father, or a lusty Widow for
an old decrepit Husband; no, I must counterfeit in a far
deeper Strain; weep like a Parent for an only Son: Is
not this a hard Task? Ha, <i>Rosco</i>?</p>

<p><i>Rosco.</i> Ah, no, my Lord, not for your Skill; in your
Youth your Lordship saw Plays, conversed with Players,
knew the fam'd <i>Alberto</i>.</p>

<p><i>Grav.</i> 'Tis true, by Heav'n, I have seen that Knave
paint Grief in such a lively Colour, that for false and acted
Passion he has drawn true Tears, the Ladies kept Time
with his Sighs, and wept to his sad Accents as if he had
truly been the Man he seem'd, then I'll try my Part,
thou hast still been privy to my Bosom Secrets; know'st
Wealth and Ambition are the Darlings of my Soul; nor
will I leave a Stratagem unessay'd to raise my Family.
My Son is well and safe, but by Command from me he
returns not this three Months. My Daughter, my <i>Lucasia</i>,
is my only Care, and to advance her Fortune have I
fram'd this Project; how dost like it, <i>Rosco</i>, ha!</p>

<p><i>Rosco.</i> Rarely, my Lord, my Lady will be now suppos'd
the Heir to all your vast Revenues, and pester'd
with more Suitors than the <i>Grecian</i> Queen, in the long
Absence of her Lord. You'll have the Dons, Lords and
Dukes swarm about your House like Bees.</p>

<p><i>Grav.</i> My Aim is fix'd at the Rich and Great, he that
has Wealth enough, yet longs for more, Count <i>Pirro</i>,
the Governor's Heir and Nephew, that rich Lord that
knows no End of his large Fortunes, yet still gapes on, for
Gold is a sure Bait to gain him, no other Loadstone can
attract his Iron Heart, 'tis proof against the Force of
Beauty, else I should not need this Stratagem, for Nature
has not prov'd a Niggard to my Daughter.</p>

<p><i>Rosco.</i> To him, I'm sure, she's play'd the Step-Dame,
I much fear <i>Lucasia</i> will not relish such a Match.</p>

<p><i>Grav.</i> Ha! not relish it! has she any other Taste but
mine, or shall she dare to wish ought that may contradict
my Purpose&mdash;But hold, perhaps you know how she's inclin'd,
you may be confederate with her, and manage her
Intrigues with that Beggar <i>Palante</i>, who is only by
Lord <i>Euphene</i>'s Bounty, my mortal Enemies, kept from
starving.</p>

<p><i>Rosco.</i> Who I, my good Lord? Heav'n knows, I have
learnt by your Lordship's Example, always to hate the
Poor, and like the Courtier, never to do ought without a
Bribe.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><i>Enter a Servant.</i>
</p></div>

<p><i>Serv.</i> My Lord, Count <i>Pirro</i>, to wait upon your Lordship.</p>

<p><i>Grav.</i> Conduct him in. [<i>Exit. Serv.</i>] Now <i>Rosco</i>,
to my Couch; if my Plot takes, I'm a happy Man.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent">
<i>Enter Count</i> Pirro.
</p></div>

<p><i>Pirro.</i> Is your Lord asleep?</p>

<p><i>Ros.</i> I think not, my Lord, but thus he lies, Heav'n
knows when this Grief will end&mdash;My Lord, my Lord,
the Count of <i>Pirro</i>.</p>

<p><i>Grav.</i> I pray your Lordship pardon me, at this Time
I'm not fit to entertain Persons of your Worth.</p>

<p><i>Pir.</i> Alas! my Lord, I know your Grief.</p>

<p><i>Ros.</i> Ay, 'twas that brought his good Lordship hither.</p>

<p><i>Pir.</i> You have lost a worthy, and a hopeful Son, but
Heav'n that always gives, will sometimes take, and
there's no Balsam left to cure these Wounds but Patience;
there's no disputing with it, yet if there were, in what
could you accuse those Pow'rs, that else have been so
liberal to you, and left you to bless your Age a beauteous
Daughter.</p>

<p><i>Ros.</i> Now it begins to work.<span class="ex">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Pirro.</i> Your Blood is not extinct, nor are you Childless,
Sir, from that fair Branch may come much Fruit to glad
Posterity; think on this, my Lord.</p>

<p><i>Grav.</i> I know I should not repine, my Lord, but Nature
will prevail, I cannot help reflecting on my Loss;
alas, my Lord, you know not what it is to lose a Son;
'tis true, I have still a Child, Heav'n has now confin'd
my Care to one, to see her well bestow'd shall be the
Business of my Life&mdash;Oh! my <i>Eugenio</i>.</p>

<p><i>Ros.</i> Egad, he does it rarely. <span class="ex">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Pirr.</i> How shall I manage, that he may not suspect my
Love to his Daughter proceeds from his Son's Death,
[<i>Aside.</i>] I was just coming to make a Proposal to your
Lordship as the News reach'd my Ear, I much fear the
Time's improper now to talk of Business.</p>

<p><i>Grav.</i> Pray Heaven it be the Business I wish; were
my Grief more great, if possible, yet would I suspend it
to hear my Lord of <i>Pirro</i>.</p>

<p><i>Ros.</i> Cunningly insinuated. <span class="ex">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Pirro.</i> Your Lordship is too obliging.</p>

<p><i>Grav.</i> Not at all, pray proceed, my Lord.</p>

<p><i>Pirro.</i> It was, my Lord, to have ask'd the fair <i>Lucasia</i>
for my Wife.</p>

<p><i>Ros.</i> So he has swallow'd the Bait.  <span class="ex">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Grav.</i> As I could wish. <span class="ex">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Pirro.</i> 'Twas not out of any Consideration of her present
Fortune, my Lord, I hope you'll not believe, since I
designed it e'er I knew <i>Eugenio</i> dead. I wish he may
believe me. <span class="ex">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Grav.</i> If 'twas, my Lord of <i>Pirro</i> does deserve it all,
nor would I wish my Child a better Match. But 'tis too
soon to treat of Marriage after such a Loss.</p>

<p><i>Rosco.</i> Dear Sir, consent to this good Lord, so will
your Care be over, and hopeful Grandsons make up poor
<i>Eugenio</i>'s Loss.</p>

<p><i>Grav.</i> What would you have me think of Joy and
Death at once, and mingle the Grave and Marriages together.</p>

<p><i>Pirro.</i> If you'll consent, my Lord, a private Marriage
may be had, and so dispense with the usual Solemnities of
Joy. If you refuse me, I shall think you slight my Claim.</p>

<p><i>Grav.</i> That Argument alone prevails: No, I will never
give the Count of <i>Pirro</i> Cause to doubt of my Esteem.</p>

<p><i>Rosco.</i> Consider, my Lord, she's an Heiress, that may
set bold desperate Youths on rash Attempts; and tho'
they know <i>Sicilian</i> Laws gives Death to him that steals

<p><i>Grav.</i> Brother, you are welcome to the House of Sorrow;

Grief, you are welcome, you, and my fair Niece.</p>

<p><i>Lar.</i> Thank you Brother&mdash;the Girl's a foolish Girl&mdash;Marriageable,

when Riches too concur; he's the Son and Heir
of my old Friend <i>Don Sancho</i>, of <i>Syracuse</i>&mdash;and the Baggage
cries <i>I hate him</i>, and yet has never seen him; but
she is in Love, forsooth, with a young beggarly Dog, not
worth a Groat; but I'll prevent her, I'll warrant her.</p>

<p><i>Grav.</i> Just, just my Case, we are Brothers in every
Thing, my Daughter too thinks her Judgment wisest,
and flies a Fortune for a Princess, but her Reign's at

<p><i>Sancho.</i> I came lately from thence.</p>

<p><i>Fran.</i> Pr'ythee, what brought you hither?</p>

<p><i>Sanc.</i> Why, that that brings some Men to the Gallows, a
Wench.</p>

<p><i>Fran.</i> What, I warrant, you have got your Bed-maker
with Child, and so are expell'd the College.</p>

<p><i>Sancho.</i> That's a Mistake.</p>

<p><i>Fran.</i> What, thou art not come hither to take Physic, ha!</p>

<p><i>Sancho.</i> No, not the Physic you mean; but am going to
enter into a Course, that is, the Course of Matrimony.</p>

<p><i>Fran.</i> Matrimony, with who, pr'ythee?</p>

<p><i>Sanc.</i> Why, with Don <i>Larich</i>'s Daughter: Do you know
her?</p>

<p><i>Fran.</i> Ha! Is this my Rival? This was a lucky Discovery,
[<i>Aside.</i>] I know her; ay, very well, Sir. I can assure
you she's very handsome, and as witty as she's fair: Thou
<ins title="original has wont">won't</ins> visit her in that Dress, sure?</p>

<p><i>Sancho.</i> To chuse, Sir, 'tis an Emblem of Learning; nay,
I design my Man shall carry a Load of Books along with
me too, that she may see what he is Master of, that is to be
Master of her.</p>

<p><i>Fran.</i> Indeed, my Friend, you'll never succeed upon
those Terms.</p>

<p><i>Tristr.</i> Sir, my Master has such an Itch to this foolish
Learning, that he bestows more Money yearly upon Books,
than would build an Hospital for all the Courtesans in <i>Italy</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sancho.</i> No more, or you'll displease me, <i>Tristram</i>.</p>

<p><i>Tristr.</i> I can't help that, Sir,&mdash;Sir, will you believe me, I
have spent two Days in sorting Poets from Historians, and as
many Nights in placing the Divines on their own Chairs,
I mean their Shelves; then separating Philosophers, from
those People that kill with a License, cost me a whole Day's
Labour; and tho' my Master says Learning is immortal, I
find the Sheets it is contain'd in savours much of Mortality.</p>

<p><i>Sancho.</i> I hope my Books are in good Case, <i>Tristram</i>?</p>

<p><i>Tristr.</i> Yes, yes, Sir, in as good Case as the Moths have
left 'em.</p>

<p><i>Sancho.</i> Od'so, I had forgot, to get me <i>Suarez Metaphysicks</i>,
<i>Tolet de Anima</i>, and <i>Granados Commentaries</i>, on
<i>Primum Secund&aelig; Thom&aelig; Aquinatis</i>.</p>

<p><i>Tristr.</i> How the Devil does he do to remember all these
Author's hard Names, I dare swear he understands not a
Syllable of their Writings<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Sir, would not the famous
History of <i>Amidis de Gaul</i> do as well?</p>

<p><i>Fran.</i> Ay, better, better far, Man, hark'ee <i>Sancho</i>, you are
not at <i>Salamanca</i> now, amongst your square Caps, but in
<i>Palermo</i>, come up to see your Mistress the fair <i>Lavinia</i>, the
Glory of the City; go and court her like a Gentleman,
without your Tropes and Figures, or all the Physics, Metaphysics,
and Metaphors, will streight be made pitiful Martyrs.</p>

<p><i>Sancho.</i> Martyrs, Sir, why, I thought&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Fran.</i> Thyself an errant Idiot, thy Brain's more dull than
a <i>Dutch</i> Burghers. Is this a Dress fit for a Gentleman to
court his Mistress in? Away, away, the Lady you speak
of, I can assure you is too much a Gallant to be taken with
a Band and a square Cap&mdash;If you would succeed, you must
throw off that Pedant, and assume the Gentleman, learn
the Toss of the Head, and know the Principles of each
Man by the Cock of his Hat.</p>

<p><i>Sancho.</i> How's that, pray?</p>

<p><i>Fran.</i> Oh! I'll teach you: If you be but willing to improve,
I'll warrant you carry the Lady.</p>

<p><i>Sanch.</i> But I am to be married to her as soon as I see her,
so my Father told me, and that her Father admired a Scholar
above all Things.</p>

<p><i>Fran.</i> I'll improve that Hint&mdash;Ay, as I told you, a
Scholar that is read in Men, not in Books.</p>

<p><i>Sancho.</i> In Men, what's that? in Men! <i>Tristram</i>, what
does he mean? what Man is to be read? In Men! I
don't understand you; but you'll teach me, you say.</p>

<p><i>Fran.</i> Ay, ay, I'll give you a Lesson upon that Subject.</p>

<p><i>Sancho.</i> Very well; but what shall I do for Cloaths to
dress like a Gentleman?</p>

<p><i>Fran.</i> If you please to step into my Lodgings here, I'll
equip you with a Suit of mine till you can have one made,
and there I'll teach you a little of the Town breeding, and
I warrant you you'll succeed.</p>

Friendship's a noble Name, 'tis Love refin'd;<br />

Let Birds of Musick always chant it here;<br />
No croaking Raven, or ill-boding Owl,<br />
Make here their baleful Habitation:<br />

To our meeting here but <i>Laura</i>; I have always<br />
Found her honest, and yet I would she did not know it.</p>

<p><i>Pal.</i> 'Tis only Fear assaults thy tender Mind;<br />

<blockquote>
<p><i>Eug.</i> Thus in Disguise I shall discover all,<br />
And find the Cause of my reported Death,<br />
Which does so much amaze me.<br />
A Month ago my Father sent me Word, that I shou'd hasten
my Journey to <i>Palermo</i>; and I met the Post upon the Road,
that gave me a Letter, wherein he strictly charges me not to
come this three Months: No sooner had I enter'd the Town,
but I met the Rumour of my Death, which still surpris'd me
more; but this Letter shall help me to the Knowledge of
the Truth.</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Shews a Letter, goes to the Door and knocks.</i></p>

<p><i>Rosc.</i> Who'd you speak with Friend?</p>

<p><i>Eug.</i> With the Lord <i>Gravello</i>, if you please, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Ros.</i> Marry gap, and can't I serve your Turn? Nothing
but my Lord, good lack! I guess he knows you not; pray
what's your Business? What's your Name? From whence
come you? What do ye want? I believe you are of no such
Extraction, that you shou'd be introduc'd to my Lord; let
me be judge, whether your Affair requires his Lordship's
Ear, else, Friend, I shall bring you but a scurvy Answer;
either he's busy, or a-sleep, or gone abroad, any of these
are sufficient for your Quality, I suppose.</p>

<p><i>Eug.</i> Thus great Men always are abus'd, because there's
no Access, but through such Knaves as thee? then I'll return
my Message back unto his Son, and bid him employ a
finer Fellow, if he expects that he should see his Father.<span class="ex">[<i>Going.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Grav.</i> The same.</p>

<p><i>Eug.</i> I came from <i>Rome</i>, my Lord; laden, I hope, with
happy Tidings, and after the sad Report I have met with,
I dare say, welcome; your Son <i>Eugenio</i> lives, and with his
Duty, recommends this Letter to your Lordship's Perusal.</p>

<p><i>Grav.</i> He writes me Word that you are a Gentleman
fallen to Decay, and begs that I would take you into my Service:
I have no Place vacant at present, but the first that
falls worth your Acceptance, shall be yours; in the mean
Time command my House. [<i>I must not let him suspect I knew</i>
Eugenio <i>was alive</i>] the happy News that thou hast brought
me, has rais'd me from the Vale of Death; but tell me,
Friend, hast thou reveal'd this to any in <i>Palermo</i>, but myself?</p>

<p><i>Eug.</i> To none. For tho' I met the tragic Story in every
Street through which I pass'd, still I conceal'd the Truth,
intending your Lordship's Ear should first receive it.</p>

<p><i>Grav.</i> Thou hast done exceeding well; <i>Rosco</i>, give him
a double Reward, a double Welcome; I have some private
Reasons to myself, that it should still be kept a Secret,
which if thou'rt faithful, thou in Time shalt know.</p>

I loath my Servitude, detest the proud Family, and

he ravisht a Sister of mine at <i>Rome</i>, for which I
never can forgive him.</p>

<p><i>Pirro.</i> This Fellow, I find is ripe for Mischief; and if I
durst trust him, wou'd, for a large Reward, remove <i>Eugenio</i>,
and make <i>Lucasia</i> indeed an Heiress; and 'twere but just,
since Count <i>Gravello</i> did design to wrong me of his Estate,
why shou'd not I rob him of his Son? where could be the
Danger of this Act; I can't fore-see any, for he has already
given it out he's dead, and therefore dares not search into
the Matter; but is it safe to trust this Stranger, he may betray
my Purpose, or not do it; yet 'tis reasonable to think
the contrary, for he hates him for his Sister's Rape, and
therefore would be glad to meet Occasion to revenge it, especially
when usher'd in by a great Sum: I'm resolv'd to
break it to him. [<i>Aside.</i>] What is your Name, Friend?</p>

<p><i>Eug. Irus</i>, my Lord.</p>

<p><i>Pirro.</i> Your Name as well as Habit speak you poor.</p>

<p><i>Eug.</i> I'm poor enough, my Lord.</p>

<p><i>Pirro.</i> Very poor?</p>

<p><i>Eug.</i> Very poor, my Lord.</p>

<p><i>Pirro.</i> Would you not gladly mend your Fortunes.</p>

<p><i>Eug.</i> I wish your Lordship would shew me the Way.</p>

<p><i>Pirro.</i> What think you now of taking Revenge for your
Sister's Rape, ha?</p>

<p><i>Eug.</i> Alas! my Lord, that I wou'd have done long ago,
but Want prevented my Escape.</p>

<p><i>Pirro.</i> Say'st thou so? my Friend: well, poison this
<i>Eugenio</i>, and thou shalt not want; for thy Reward, a thousand
Crowns are thine.</p>

<p><i>Eug.</i> Think it done, my Lord, nor will I receive my
Hire till I have brought you a certain Proof <i>Eugenio</i> is no
more; all I ask is but your Hand to the Agreement, my
Lord, that I may be sure of my Reward.</p>

<p><i>Pirro.</i> I'll give it thee<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>We must be safe, for his Father
will be asham'd to prosecute, after his reported Death. I
must confess I lov'd <i>Lucasia</i> as an Heiress, but was she ten

therefore make sure my Fortune by thy Master's Death.</p>

<p><i>Pirro.</i> I had, my Lord, but am unjustly robb'd of that

<p><i>Luc.</i> If <i>Palante</i> dies, I cannot live, for we<br />
Have but one Heart, and can have but one Fate.</p>

<p><i>Gov.</i> What I can do, I will to save him, but Law must
have its Course, rise Madam.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Never till<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
The gracious Word of Pardon raises me,<br />
There's Pity in your Eye, oh! shew it, Sir!<br />
And say that he shall live, 'tis but a Word,<br />
But oh, as welcome as the Breath of Life,<br />
Why will you part two Hearts that Heav'n has join'd?<br />
He is my Husband, Sir, and I his wedded Wife.</p>

<p><i>Gov.</i> That can plead no Excuse, for 'tis your Crime, but
if I shou'd incline to pity you, what wou'd you return? what
wou'd you do to purchase the Life of him you hold so dear?</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> You cannot think the Thing I would not do.<br />
Speak, Sir, and lay it but in my Power,<br />
And even beyond my Power I will attempt.</p>

<p><i>Gov.</i> You wou'd be thankful then shou'd I pardon him?</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> If I were ever thankful unto Heav'n<br />
For all that I call mine, my Health and Being,<br />
Cou'd I then be unthankful unto you,<br />
For a Gift I value more than those?<br />
Without which all other Blessings will be tasteless.</p>

<p><i>Gov.</i> Those that are thankful study to requite, wou'd you
do so?</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> As far as I am capable I will,<br />
Tho' I can ne'er make ample Satisfaction,<br />
All my Services to you are Duty,<br />
But to those Pow'rs above that can requite<br />
That from their Wasteless Treasure daily heap<br />
Rewards more out of Grace than merit on<br />
Us Mortals;<br />
To those I'll pray that they wou'd give you, Sir,<br />
More Blessings than I have Skill to ask.</p>

<p><i>Gov.</i> There rises one Way and but one to save him.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Oh! name it, Sir, that<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
Swift as the Arrow from the Archer's Hand<br />
My trembling Feet may fly to save him,<br />
Oh! you have rais'd me from the Gulph of Grief<br />
To that blest comfortable Region, Hope,<br />
My Senses all dance in the Cirque of Joy.<br />
My ravish'd Heart leaps up to hear your Words,<br />
And seems as 'twou'd come forth to thank you.<br />
Say, how, how shall I save him?</p>

<p><i>Gov.</i> Marry my Nephew <i>Pirro</i> and <i>Palante</i> lives.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Oh! unexpected Turn of rigid Fate,<br />
Cruel, Sir, far more cruel than my Father.<br />
Why did you raise me to a Height of Joy?<br />
To sink me in a Moment down again,<br />
In what a sad Dilemma stands my Choice,<br />
Either to wed the Man my Soul most loaths,<br />
Or see him die for whom alone I live.<br />
To break my sacred Vows to Heav'n and him,<br />
To save a Life which he would scorn to take<br />
On Terms like those, name any Thing but that,<br />
You are more just than to enforce my Will,<br />
Why should I marry one I cannot love,<br />
And sure I am I cannot love Count <i>Pirro</i>,<br />
Love him! no, I shou'd detest and loath him.<br />
The Cause that made him mine, wou'd hourly add<br />
Fresh Matter for my Hate.</p>

<p><i>Gov.</i> You have your Choice, I swear by Heaven never to
pardon him, but upon these Conditions.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Oh! I am miserable.</p>

<p><i>Gov.</i> 'Tis your own Fault, come consider Madam, <i>Palante</i>
will thank you for his Life, and if you let him die, you
are the Tyrant.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> I shou'd be such if I shou'd save him thus.<br />
Since you have swore not to save him upon<br />
Other Terms, I'll shew a duteous Cruelty<br />
And rather follow him in Death than so<br />
To buy his Life, no, I despise the Price.<br />
Why do I breathe my Woes, or beg for Mercy here;<br />
Or hope to find plain Honesty in Courts?<br />
No, their Ears are always stopp'd against Justice,<br />
Avarice and Pride supplies the Place of Pity.</p>

you? Alas I was engaged long before I saw you, you may
be happier far elsewhere, go court some Nymph whose

I have so often heard you say, you lov'd, think what

<p><i>Fran.</i> I am poor, I must confess, in regard of your large

your Wealth was the Foundation of true-built Love, it was
her single uncompounded self, her self without Addition
that I lov'd, which shall ever in my Heart out-weigh all
other Womens Fortunes with themselves, and were I great,
great as I cou'd wish myself for her Advancement, no such

because I made a brave Resistance, they ne'er wou'd give
me Leave to offer at my Ransom, so violent was their Hate,
but now worn out with Age, unfitting for their Labour,
they turn'd me Home, an useless Drone, your Son they

thee once to lose thee ever?</p>

<p><i>Euph.</i> 'Twas Nature then that worked my Soul, and I
by Instinct lov'd him. Oh my <i>Alphonso</i>, this Discovery
comes too late, and instead of bringing Comfort to my
Age, thou hast plung'd me down in deep Despair.</p>

That thou, <i>Palante</i>, wer't condemn'd to die.</p>

<p><i>Eug.</i> Still all I ask is, that you wou'd have Patience;<br />
I'll to Court where Lord <i>Euphenes</i> is,<br />
Now begging for his Son, in Hope to bring you Happiness. <span class="ex">[<i>Exit</i>&nbsp;Eug.</span></p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Fly <i>Irus</i>, fly, and bring us instant Word.<br />
Oh! my aking Brain is near Distraction;<br />
For much I fear there is no Help for me.</p>

<p><i>Pal.</i> Yet I rejoice in this, I'm found of Noble Birth&mdash;<br />
That in succeeding Ages, when this Act,<br />
With all its Circumstances shall be told,<br />
No Blot may rest upon thy Virgin Fame;<br />
No censuring Tongue reflect upon thy Choice;<br />
And say thy Husband was a Wretch unknown,<br />
And quite unworthy of <i>Lucasia</i>'s Arms.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> What Comfort's in this late Discovery found?<br />
Will the Greatness of thy Race protect thee?<br />
Virtue and ev'ry Good was thine before;<br />
Yet the cruel Pow'rs are deaf to all my Prayers:<br />
Nor will thy Merit plead with angry Heav'n,<br />
To ward the Stroke, and save thy precious Life.<br />
Oh Greatness! thou vain and vap'rish Shew,<br />
That, like a Mist, dazzles the Eyes of Men,<br />
And as the Fogs destroy the Body's Health,<br />
That poisons deep, and gangrenes in the Soul;<br />
But seldom's found t' assist the virtuous Man.<br />
Thou wert<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
As dear to these desiring Eyes before,<br />
And honour'd full as much in this poor Heart.<br />
Oh! I cou'd curse the Separating Cause,<br />
And wish <i>Lucasia</i> never had been born.</p>

<p><i>Pal.</i> Be calm, my Love, my everlasting Dear,<br />
Cease to lament, and give thy Spirits ease.<br />
Oh! hear me Heav'n, and grant my last Request;<br />
May Health, long Life, and ev'ry Bliss beside,<br />
Conduce to make <i>Lucasia</i> happy still.<br />
Let nothing fall to interrupt her Joy,<br />
But make it lasting as you make it great.<br />
Grant this, and I to rigorous Destiny<br />
Submit with Pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Long Life; no, rather wish me sudden Death,<br />
To rid me of my Cares, and that Way give me Ease.<br />
Ha! I'm seiz'd with an unusual Terror, Fear<br />
And Horror swim in Shades of Night around,<br />
How sad and dreadful are these Prison Walls!<br />
Thy Voice seems hollow too, and Face looks pale.<br />
Oh! my <i>Palante</i>, my Heart<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
Throbs, as if the Strings of Life were breaking.</p>
<p class="right">[<i>A Bell tolls within.</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Hark! hark! Oh! 'twas this that it foretold.<br />

Do not push me from thee, my dear <i>Palante</i>;<br />

<i>Enter Governor and Count</i> Pirro, <i>and Lord</i> Gravello.</p></div>

<p><i>Govern.</i> This is strange <i>Palante</i> should be found
The Lord <i>Euphene</i>'s Son; but fear not Nephew, the Law
has pass'd, and he shall suffer.</p>

<p><i>Pirro.</i> I urge still, my Lord, she was my promised Wife;
Her Father so design'd her, had he then been known
Euphene's Son. I urge that, speak my good Father.</p>

<p><i>Grav.</i> My Lord, I had; yet let me own, I rather wish
the unknown <i>Palante</i> had suffer'd for my Daughter, than
the Son of one, who tho' my Foe, I must acknowledge great
and brave.</p>

<p><i>Govern.</i> So wou'd I my Lord, but there's no Fence for
Accidents; I do expect to be beset with Prayers and Tears,
but all in vain; see where he comes.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">
<i>Enter</i> Euphenes <i>and</i> Alphonso.</p></div>

<p><i>Euph.</i> Behold! Lord Governor, my aged Knees, are bent to thee,<br />
'Tis in thy Power to wrest this heavy Judgment of the Law;<br />
Suspend it at least, till the King shall hear the Cause,<br />
And save my Son.</p>

<p><i>Gover.</i> Rise <i>Euphenes</i>, your Speech carries a double
Meaning, you pray and threaten with the same Breath,
we are not to be frighted Lord; the Laws of <i>Sicily</i> have
had their Course, your Son falls by them.</p>

<p><i>Euph.</i> Oh! mistake me not, I am as humble as your Pride
can wish me; but give me Leave to speak, tho' 'tis my hard
Fortune to offend; let me the Anguish of my Soul deliver to
that injurious Lord, the Father of <i>Lysander</i>'s, or by the more
known Name, <i>Palante</i>'s Wife; hard-hearted Man! had'st
thou no other Way to wreck thy canker'd and long foster'd
Hate upon my Head, but this? Thus cruelly, by my Son's
Suffering, and for such a Fault as thou shou'dst Love him,
rather? Is thy Daughter injur'd by this Marriage? Is his
Blood base? Or can his now rising Fortunes know an Ebb?
This Law was made to restrain the Vile from wronging
noble Persons, by Attempts of such a kind; but where
Equality meets in the Match, there is no Crime! or if there
is, forgive his Youth, and have Pity on him.</p>

<p><i>Gover. Euphenes</i>, you wrong your Virtue when you'd save
a Criminal, the Law condemns; tho' the righteous Judgment
falls upon your Son, and your Appeal shall come too
late.</p>

<p><i>Euph.</i> Then you have set a Period to a loyal House and
Family that have been Props of the <i>Sicilian</i> Crown and with
their Blood in Wars, won many an honour'd Field. I can
spend no more in Tears, I'll spend the sad Remnant of my
childless Age, and only wish to rest i'th' Grave together.</p>

<p><i>Alph.</i> Hear me thou Governor, not kneeling, but erect as
old Age and Slavery has left me: This noble <i>Sicilian</i> Youth
was lost in defending <i>Sicily</i> from the fam'd Fortress, which
beat back a thousand Times, invading Foes, and sunk 'em
in the working Seas, from thence the Child was ta'en, and
must he 'scape the Hazards of the rowling Waves, Rocks,
Tempests, Pirates, and ignominious Fate, to perish in his
native Isle: Oh, barbarous Usage, stop yet at least his
Judgment, and let this poor old Man see once again, his
dear <i>Palante</i>; for that I'll bow my stubborn Knees, and ask
the Blessings as I importune Heaven.</p>

<p><i>Euph.</i> Oh! my Lord, let my unhappy Son appear before
ye, e'er the cruel Sentence comes to Execution.</p>

<p><i>Grav.</i> If you deny them this, it may be ill represented to
the King.</p>

<p><i>Pirro.</i> I fear, my Lord, you are staggering.</p>

<p><i>Gover.</i> Nephew, be silent, and be safe; they shall have
their Will, but to no Purpose, only a Moment's short Delay;
for I have sworn, and he shall die<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Guard bring here the
Prisoner.</p>

<p><i>Euph.</i> I thank the Governor.</p>

<p><i>Gov.</i> Oh spare thy Thanks, till thou hast real Cause:
the Law, the Statute's plain, and he must die for't, there is
no Remedy.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">
<i>Enter, brought in by the Guards</i>,<br />
Palante, Clerimont, Lucasia <i>and</i> Eugenio.</p></div>

<p><i>Euph.</i> Oh! Son!</p>

<p><i>Alph. Palante!</i></p>

<p><i>Pal.</i> Pardon me, Sirs, I have too much Tenderness
upon my Soul already, too many Clogs that drag it downwards;
oh! forgive me, if I beg ye wou'd not add more
Weight to Death.</p>

<p><i>Gra.</i> Madam, 'twere more becoming your Quality
and Modesty, to be at Home; thou dost but ill return
thy Father's Care.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> I have no Father, nor ever had that I remember,
but born and destin'd for an out-cast Wretch, and curst to
ruin a most noble Husband: Oh he was the Pride of the
<i>Sicilian</i> Youths, and Glory of the World; but he is dead,
or doom'd to die, and that's alike distracting.</p>

<p><i>Euph.</i> Heav'n bless thee, thou Mirrour of thy Sex,
that in the Sea of thy transcendant Virtues, drown'st all
thy Father's Malice, and in my Thought, redeem'st more
than thy Race can lose.</p>

<p><i>Gov.</i> Lord <i>Euphenes</i>, what End had you in this, in
bringing here the Criminals?</p>

<p><i>Euph.</i> To move your Mercy was my End; but Wolves
and Tygers know not what Pity means.</p>

<p><i>Gov.</i> Forbear Reproach, and hear me; I'll stand it
to the King, and all the World; here is an Heiress stole, the
worst of Robberies; he is condemn'd by the Law, he fell
to the Judgment of the Law; I surrender him. Guards,
carry on the Pris'ners.</p>

<p><i>Luca.</i> Oh! cruel Sentence! hear me, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Gov.</i> Away with 'em.</p>

<p><i>Eug.</i> Stay yet a little, thou most imperious Governor;
for I will be heard.</p>

<p><i>Gov.</i> Thou! What art thou?</p>

<p><i>Eug.</i> My Name is <i>Irus</i>; Lord <i>Pirro</i> knows me.</p>

<p><i>Pirro.</i> Ha!</p>

<p><i>Eug.</i> Thou tremblest, Lord, hear; you that have condemn'd
these noble Friends, and hunt their Lives for a
mere Trifle; sentence to Death a Man for loving and being
belov'd; hear, a black Deed will start your Soul with
Horror, and make you own the Crime before ye nothing.</p>

<p><i>Gov.</i> What means the Fellow!</p>

<p><i>Eug.</i> Nay, 'tis not a Frown can stop me, nor will my
Fate be long; know then, this Lord gave out his Son
<i>Eugenio</i> dy'd at <i>Rome</i>, but he was well, and in this City.</p>

<p><i>Palan.</i> How say'st thou?</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Proceed, dear <i>Irus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Eug.</i> First stop Lord <i>Pirro</i>; for my Story will not
please him: I say <i>Eugenio</i> lived; which when I discover'd
to that trembling Lord, he brib'd me with a thousand
Crowns to poison him: Here's the Agreement under his
own Hand; and here's a Letter from <i>Eugenio</i> to his
Father, which denotes that he was poison'd, and dying.</p>

<p><i>Gra.</i> Let me see it: Oh! 'tis his Hand. Wretch that
I am, is my dissembled Grief turn'd to true Sorrow?
Were my acted Tears but Prophecies of my ensuing Woe?
And is he dead? Oh! pardon me, dear Ghost of my
<i>Eugenio</i>! 'twas my Crimes that call'd this hasty Vengeance
from above, and shorten'd thus thy Life; for
whilst with Fallacies I sought to fasten Wealth upon our
House, I brought a Cannibal to be the Grave of me and
mine; base, bloody, murdering Lord.</p>

<p><i>Pirro.</i> Vile Cozener, Cheater and Dissembler, now indeed
we both are caught.</p>

<p><i>Euph.</i> Oh! cruel Man! now see the Justice of offended
Heav'n; thou who pursu'st the poor <i>Palante</i>'s Life
with so much Violence, thou now must feel the Weight of
a Son's Loss.</p>

<p><i>Gov.</i> This will prove a Tragedy indeed; away with
the Prisoners. Your Trial's next, Lord <i>Pirro</i>.</p>

<p><i>Pirro.</i> I do confess<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Eug.</i> Hold, is there no means left to save them?
Wou'd not you now, Lord <i>Gravello</i>, give your Daughter
freely to <i>Palante</i>?</p>

<p><i>Gra.</i> More willingly than I wou'd live another Hour.</p>

<p><i>Euph.</i> Oh! You are kind too late; had you been thus
when Need required, you had sav'd yourself and me, and
both our hapless Sons.</p>

<p><i>Gov.</i> Oh Nephew, my Prompter still in Cruelty,<br />
Now thou thyself must feel the Rigour of the Law.</p>

<p><i>Eug.</i> Now ye behold the Good from Bad, which
nought but this Extremity had shewn; yet all be safe,
<i>Eugenio</i> lives, and fair <i>Lucasia</i> is no Heiress now.</p>

<p><i>Omnes.</i> How! lives!</p>

<p><i>Eug.</i> Yes, lives to call thee Brother, worthy <i>Palante</i>,
and thou, my dear <i>Lucasia</i>, Sister.</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Throws&nbsp;off&nbsp;his&nbsp;Disguise.</i></p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Oh, <i>Irus, Eugenio, Palante</i>, where am I?</p>

<p><i>Palan.</i> Oh! <i>Lucasia, Clerimont</i>; my Friend, my Love,
my Wife.</p>

<p><i>Eug.</i> Pardon me ye most afflicted Sufferers,<br />
That I thus long have kept myself conceal'd;<br />
My End was honest, to let my Father see<br />
The Frailty, I will not call it by a harder Name,<br />
Of Count <i>Pirro</i>; the Son he coveted so eagerly,<br />
To raise the Storms to their most dreadful Height,<br />
That Calms, and Peace might be more pleasing.</p>

<p><i>Gra.</i> I see it was <i>Eugenio</i>, and thou <i>Palante</i>.<br />
Now, my Son, give me thy Hand, here take thy Wife,<br />
And for the Wrong that I intended thee, thy Portion<br />
shall be double.</p>

<p><i>Pal.</i> Oh! I am over-paid, <i>Lucasia</i> and my Friend secure.
This is the Work of Heav'n, and oh ye gracious Powers
I thank ye for it.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Joy rises from my Heart, and with unutterable
Transports stops my Speech; thus once again let me embrace
thee.</p>

<p><i>Euph.</i> And has a Father nothing from a Son?</p>

<p><i>Alph.</i> And old <i>Alphonso</i> too expects a Welcome.</p>

<p><i>Pal.</i> Oh! take me, Father, Brother, Friend, <i>Lucasia</i>!
There's the Sum of all.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Sure such Hours as these give us a Taste of Immortality.</p>

<p><i>Gra.</i> My Lord <i>Euphenes</i>, I hope all Enmity is now
forgot betwixt our Houses.</p>

<p><i>Euph.</i> Let it be ever so; I do embrace your Love.<br />
But speak <i>Eugenio</i>, what hast thou to ask?<br />
Whose timely Care prevented our undoing.</p>

<p><i>Eug.</i> My Lord, you have a virtuous Niece, for whom
I long have sigh'd, I beg your leave to own my Flame.</p>

<p><i>Euph.</i> She's yours; I've often heard her praise <i>Eugenio</i>.
And all Things else within my Power command.<br />
My Lord the Governor, you alone seem sad.</p>

<p><i>Gov.</i> I am not so at your good Fortune, but that my
Nephew whom I have found so base, urg'd me to such
Cruelty: Be gone, and hide thy ignominious Head, for I
will never see thee more.</p>

<p><i>Pirro.</i> No matter, I am free, and will enjoy myself in
spight of all Mankind. <span class="ex">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Gov.</i> However this my Care shall do, I will solicit earnestly
the King to mitigate this cruel Law, and make the Thefts of Love admit of Pardon.<br />
Who have we here? they seem to rejoice too.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Larich.</i> Ha, hey, what, every body in Joy! Good

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
